## Dependencies

The components created in this library are maintained with Storybook.

## Components
Component files consist of the following:

- Dependency imports
- Interface declaration
- Component definitions
- Export

__Dependency Imports__ are where any components, styles or other useful things that the component may utilise are defined.

__Interface Declaration__ is where the props that can be passed to the component are defined.

__Component Definitions__ are the step where the actual components code is written

__Export__ is when the various components are exported to be used in other files.
